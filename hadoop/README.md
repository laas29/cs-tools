# HADOOP using Vagrant

This tutorial will walk students through the process of setting up a reasonable environment for Hadoop programming using [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com).  

## Background

We will deploy a portable cluster with the following configuration:
* Four nodes running Linux CentOS 6.5
* Hadoop 1.0.3 (this is quiet old but sufficient for what what want to do!)

## Install Pre-Requisites

* Download the latest version of [vagrant] software for your operating system.
* Download the latest version of [VirtualBox](http://virtualbox.org) software for your operating system.

## Start compute nodes

```
vagrant ssh node1
cd /vagrant/wordcount
hadoop namenode -format
start-all.sh
hadoop dfs -copyFromLocal gutenberg/ /user/vagrant/gutenberg
hadoop dfs -ls /user/vagrant/gutenberg
hadoop jar /opt/hadoop-1.0.3/hadoop-examples-1.0.3.jar wordcount /user/vagrant/gutenberg /user/vagrant/gutenberg-out
hadoop dfs -copyToLocal /user/vagrant/gutenberg-out out
```

## Writing your own hadoop programming

This part will require that you have the cluster setup correctly.

```
cd /vagrant/wordcount
make
hadoop dfs -copyFromLocal wordcount /user/vagrant/bin/wordcount
hadoop dfs -ls bin/
sh run.sh
```
